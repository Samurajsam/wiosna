# zadanie
Simple application for adding, editing and deleting location data.
The application was created using the Laravel framework.

How to use:
1) In the project root directory there is a file named "zadanie.sql", it is a database that should be run locally (eg by phpmyadmin)
2) After uploading the database, run the command line from the root folder level and enter the command: php artisan serve
Thanks to it, the server will be launched.
3) The next step is to open the generated address in the browser and add to it /wspolrzednes so that we will be redirected to the main page of the project
Example:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/wspolrzednes
